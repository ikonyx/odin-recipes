# Odin Recipes

## Description
This is my first project within the Oden Project path. I practiced writing basic html and css by building a really simple [recipes website](https://ikonyx.github.io/odin-recipes/).


## Topics I practiced on
- HTML structure.
- Basic CSS selectors and properties.
- The cascade.
- The box model.
  

## New properties used

I used the `Object-fit` CSS property to display images inline with the same size without having to stretch any image.
